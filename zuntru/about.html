                <h2 class = "text-center"><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h2>
                <p>We are a distributed team of content, marketing and technology enthusiasts who live and breathe creativity. There are multiple digital agencies out there, so why did we start another? First, while most of them have been delivering services, especially social media services, but how many have you come across that offer a solution? How many first ask you your objectives and then define end goals, based on which they would devise a solution? As digital gets more and more measurable and even more confusing (for people not in this space), we envisioned a company where everything is result oriented. If for you the end goal is more revenue, then we work towards that, rather than just giving you plain creative ideas! Second, we need to form a company culture where great talent can contribute from anywhere in the world which means we are totally location independent.</p>
                <p>Our vision is to create a digital media company wherein the focus is solely on our client's customers and company culture.

                <h2 class = "text-center"><strong>Our Core Values</strong></h2>
                    <h4><strong>1. Transparency</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We take pride in opportunities to share our beliefs, failures, strengths and decisions.
                        </li>
                        <li>We always state our thoughts with honesty.
                        </li>
                        <li>We share early in the decision process to avoid "big revelations".
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>2. Have a Focus on Self Improvement.</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We constantly focus on our current level of productivity and happiness, and make continual changes to grow.
                        </li>
                        <li>We regularly and deliberately do things that make us feel uncomfortable.</li>
                        <li>We practice activities and develop habits that will improve our mind and body.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>3. Listen First, Then Listen More</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We seek first to understand, then to be understood.
                        </li>
                        <li>We focus on listening rather than responding.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>4. Make Time to Reflect</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We deliberately find time for reflection, because that's where our life-changing adjustments come from.
                        </li>
                        <li>We understand the value of patience and treat it as a muscle which needs practice to grow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong><p> 5. Live Smarter, Not Harder</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We value waking up fresh over working that extra hour.
                        </li>
                        <li>We always aim to be fully engaged in an activity, or resting.
                        </li>
                        <li>We are at the top of our game, as we focus on expanding capacity of our mental, physical, emotional and spiritual energy.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>6. Show Gratitude</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We regularly stop and are grateful for our circumstances.
                        </li>
                        <li>We approach customer conversations with humility and the knowledge that it's a privilege to serve these people.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>7. Do the right thing</strong></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We choose what's best for customers and the company in the long-term.
                        </li>
                        <li>We correct the mistake even when no one would notice.
                        </li>
                        <li>We strive to provide the best solution, even if that means foregoing profit.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
